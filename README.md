This repository is a full guide of my studies about Javascript. Feel free to use and explore. You can go to **notes.md** archive to read more about what is in the next lines in more details.

## The Language

Javascript was created by Brendan Eich of the Netscape Entreprise in 1995. It's a high-level interpreted and multi-paradigms language that supports the paradigms of object-oriented, functional and structured programming. Furthermore, It has dinamic typing and figure on top of world wide web alongside HTML and CSS.

## Fundamentals

Some of the fundamentals of every programming language are algorithms, variables, operators, conditions and repeating structures and functions.

### Algorithm

In technology algorithm is a bunch of steps that tells the machine to execute what you want. Here comes the programming languages which are the languages that machines understand. One of the best examples of an algorithm is the action of brushing teeth. Every morning you do the same steps, right?

1. You wake up
2. Go to the bathroom
3. Pick up the toothbrush
4. Put toothpaste
5. Brush your teeth's
6. Then, you turn on the faucet
7. Finally, you washes your mouth

But we don't tell the machine to wash it's tooth's. So, what the functionality of one algorithm and programming? 
The act of brushing teeth are only one the things that every single human do the same way every day, to we understand what are algorithms: actions after actions, steps by steps, to solve one problem: brush our teeths - or whatever we want the machine to do.

### Variables

An variable is a space at our machine memory allocated to store values. So, we can create a variable called **name** to store anyone's name for future use. But, one of the most and important and abviously things about variables is that it's they change. They vary in function of the time.
At this point, you know that your money on your favorite bank are stored in.. guess what? A variable.

In construction..
